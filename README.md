## Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This week I had to build a portfolio page to which I would be adding to throughout the course duration.

The portfolio will be setting me up for success when it comes to my career search after the bootcamp. Having a couple of deployed projects will allow me to highlight my skills as well as the though process behind it. 

I didnt have enoguh web applications at the moment so I have used placeholder images and names for the time. I will eventually be changing them to real application as I create them later in the course .

Some criteria that were necessary to deploy a portfolio were:

- My name, a photo or avatar, and links to sections about myself, my work and how to contact me were included
- Clicking navigation links made the ui scroll to the corresponding section
- Clicking on link about my work , made us scroll to section with titled image of devlopers application
- The first application image is larger in size compared to others
clicking on images of the applications, takes to the deployed application and when resizing the page or viewing on various screens and devices you get responsive layout that adapts

### Mock up: 

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:
